# Database Website

This is my database interface deliverable, which is designed as an employee database for a small bank.

## Running the interface

You will need to ensure you have [Node.js (14.15.1 or later)](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

While in the public folder, within the 'Employee Database Interface', run ```node index.js``` and navigate to *127.0.0.1:8000* in your preferred browser. You will start on the homepage.

## Usage

You will start on the home page on the site. You can view the list of all employees here, and can hover over different employees and click the details button to view their details. You can also use the navbar to navigate to the search page and search for an employee by name, division or date joined (which can be changed using the filter). You can use the name 'Thomas', division 'Public Relations' and the year '2009' or the date '09/12/2008' as examples to yield results on the each filter setting.

On each employee page, you can use the previous button to go back to the last page in it's previous state, and you can use the hierarchy section to go straight to the page of another employee. You can also use the navbar to navigate back to the home or search page, if necessary.

Make sure to fully explore each unique page (there is no need to view all the employee pages as they are very similar) and the content it has to offer!

## Testing

Please run ```npm i``` while in the 'Employee Database Interface' folder to install puppeteer files. Once your node_modules have been installed, you can use ```npm run test``` to run the test script.
