# Entertainment Website

This is my entertainment website deliverable, which is designed as streaming site pre-login.

## Running the interface

Run the index.html file in the public folder, within the 'Pre-login Streaming Website' folder, by any means (I used the live server extension in visual studio code) and you will be taken to the home page of the site.

## Usage

You will start on the home page of the site. On each page, you can use the navbar or footer of each page to navigate to other pages. The button at the bottom of the homepage will take you to the subscribe page. The carousel on the featured page can be interacted with, and you can explore the different options.

Each form has success and failure cases. If you fill in a field incorrectly, you will be met with an error. If you fill in all fields correctly, you will be met with a success alert. For the login form, valid credentials are:

Email: admin@watch.it | Password: admin!\
Email: tom@mail.uk | Password: PASSword

Make sure to fully explore each page and the content it has to offer!

## Testing

You will need to ensure you have [Node.js (14.15.1 or later)](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Please run ```npm i``` while in the 'Pre-login Streaming Website' folder to install express and puppeteer files. Once your node_modules have been installed, you can use ```npm run test``` to run the test script.
