# A study in Human Computer Interaction

This is the repository for my final year project on Human Computer Interaction.
It contains three interfaces, each of which contains a readme which contains running and usage instructions. All documentation belongs to it's relevant deliverable.\
The proof of concepts folder contains the interfaces submitted in my interim submission, which are not included in my final submission.

## Author and Support

All interfaces were designed and developed by Thomas Hesketh\
